# FIFA-World-Cup-Winner-Prediction-Using-Poisson-Distribution
This project predicts the FIFA World Cup champion using historical data, match fixtures, and simulations. By leveraging web scraping, Poisson distribution modeling, and a data-driven approach, this project stands as a demonstration of my data analysis and machine learning skills acquired during my bootcamp.
### Project Highlights
Utilized BeautifulSoup and requests for scraping real match data.
Modeled match outcomes using the Poisson distribution.
Created a pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
Simulated full tournament scenarios, from group stages to knockout rounds.
### Repository Structure
File Name	Purpose
train_model.ipynb	Trains the Poisson-based model for predicting match results.
historical_data_analysis.ipynb	Analyzes historical FIFA World Cup data for patterns and insights.
generate_dictionary.ipynb	Generates a dictionary of useful references (e.g., teams, groups, etc.).
group_stage_extraction.ipynb	Extracts and organizes data for group stage matches.
data_cleaning.ipynb	Cleans and prepares raw data for modeling.
fifa_fixture_cleaned.csv	Cleaned FIFA World Cup fixture data.
### Technologies Used
#### Libraries:
#### Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
#### BeautifulSoup, requests: Web scraping tools.
#### scipy.stats: For Poisson distribution and statistical modeling.
#### pickle: Model persistence for faster reusability.
#### string: Utilities for text processing.

### Installation
#### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fifa-worldcup-prediction.git
cd fifa-worldcup-prediction
#### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
#### Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works
### Data Collection:

Match fixtures and historical FIFA World Cup data are scraped from reliable online sources.
### Data Cleaning:

Fixes inconsistencies, removes duplicates, and standardizes data formats.
### Model Training:

Uses Poisson distribution to calculate probabilities for different match outcomes.
### Simulation:

Simulates the tournament using probabilities generated by the model.
### Prediction:

Outputs the predicted winner and detailed results for all matches.

## Sample Results
#### Predicted Winner: Argentina
#### Top Goalscoring Teams: Brazil, France
#### Most Likely Final: France vs. Brazil

## Future Enhancements
#### Add more advanced modeling techniques (e.g., Elo ratings).
#### Integrate dashboards with Streamlit or Plotly for interactive analysis.
#### Incorporate real-time match updates to refine predictions dynamically.
